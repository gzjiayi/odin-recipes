            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 croissants - sliced in half</li>
                <li>8 slices sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>8 slices deli ham</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>⅓ cup Whole Milk</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>½ cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange bottom half of croissants in Ia single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Place one slice of ham and one slice of cheese on each croissant.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Pour egg mixture into greased pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to gently stir the eggs, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as you are stirring so eggs cook evenly.</li>
                <li>Once eggs begin to look mostly cooked, stir in shredded mozzarella cheese until melted and combined, then finish cooking eggs to your liking. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Top ham and cheese with a large scoop of scrambled eggs. Top with second half of the croissant buns. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until cheddar cheese is melty and croissants are toasted.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately OR allow to cool completely before wrapping individually in plastic wrap and freezing. To reheat, unwrap, place on a paper towel and microwave for 1 minute or until heated through.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <p><em>Freezer friendly:</em>wrap tightly individually with plastic wrap, store in ziploc bag in the freezer up to one month. Reheat individually and serve.</p>
